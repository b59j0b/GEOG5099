Aims 
Develop students’   knowledge of   laser scanning and   introduce   point cloud   processing.   Provide an opportunity to   use the   latest survey equipment.
Learning outcomes 
Having   completed this exercise, students will   be able to:
•          Plan and   execute   a   laser   scanning   project from   reconnaissance to   final   3ddeliverable.
Exercise Background 
Having completed the various tutorials and working examples   from the   databases   provided,   students should   have sufficient   knowledge to   commence working with a   set of scans to produce   a   3D   model   of   your   own   scanned   data.
Exercise Overview

Planning/Reconnaissance  Fieldwork Select suitable object(s)/area to scan.   In your group,   decide   on   number and   location   of   instrument      setups.   Perform. your   data collection with the   laser scanner.   Each group will   have an   assigned ‘data   controller / documenter’ to ensure   key   data,   photos, videos,   sketches   etc   are   collected   onsite   and      issued to any   remote group members.
Processing 
Individually   process data   and write   report.   Everyone will   be   issued their   data after each group   has performed the data collection.   Commence   processing –   registration   in   Register 360   and modelling   in   3DR and   report writing. 
Processing / Reporting  Issue 
Individuals finish   processing,   reporting and submit work.
Exercise Instructions  What is Expected of You
After group   data   collection   each   person will   be able to access their own   data   which   should   be   imported   to   a   new   project   of   your   own.
If you   used the ‘traverse’   method of scanning   in the field, your scans   should   already   be registered together.   If   using   registration in field tools, then registration   can   be   performed   again   / finalised   in office. Comparisons   between any   registration techniques   can   also   be   made.   You will   need to complete the   Regiser360   process   regardless to   perform. any checks, generate   QC   report   and take any   screenshots. 
Modelling:
Once you are   happy with the   registration, and   originalscan data   has   been clea代 写GEOG5099 – Applied Land SurveyWeb
代做程序编程语言ned   of   unwanted   artefacts, you should attempt to   model your   data to   create a   good   3D   representation   of   your object/area.
Modelling   can   be   performed   in   various   ways   e.g.   patches   or   using   meshes – you   will   need   to experiment to see what   provides the   best   results for your   objects   /   environments.
You can   use   mesh functions   and drape a   texture/image   over the   mesh.   If you   use this   method,   you should attempt to fill any   gaps   caused   by   ‘scanning   shadows’   etc.
You should   use   patches and geometric objects to   create a   good   model   of your   object/area   where   possible.   Note some   new features will   be available within   updated software.
Report 
Each student should submit a short,   illustrated   report   -   summarising   the   main   processes   and success/shortcomings   of   their   modelling   attempts   -   no   longer   than   2   (A4)   pages   (including   images)   -   submit via   Moodle.   In your   report you   should   state explicitly which   model   space view/similar contains the finished   product
The   report should   highlight the   recce/collection,   registration and   modelling   performed on   project.   Discussion of   issues, encountered, quality   (with   respect to survey and visual   aspects)   of   final products. Key aspects of   registration   report should   be   highlighted / referenced   in your   own written    report   but   do   not   replicate   everything-   I   will   be   looking   at   both.   Max   report   length   2   pages   (font   size 12)   References   can   go   on   a   page   3.   No   Appendix.
Data Submission: 
As   above – 2 pdf   files   to   moodle   and   1   data   zip   via   file   transfer   protocol.    I   need   a   zip   file   (zip   or 7z) of   your   complete   project   file   out   from   3DR.
The 3DR project output should be submitted using the University’s file transfer service.

Data storage 
It is   important that you each work   on your   own   set   of   data,   so   it   would   be   sensible to   make   a folder   on the   local   drive of the   PC you select and work   from there.   DO   NOT   LEAVE   YOUR   DATA   ON THE   PC when you are   not working there.   MOVE   IT TO YOUR   HOME SPACE   or   ONTO   A PERSONAL   DRIVE   (and   make your own   backup copy) so that   others   cannot   interfere with your   work. Copy   it   back to the   local drive for   continued work. Alternatively work from   a   suitable personal   hard disk attached to the   PC.   Remember to   have a   backup   of your   work.
